This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project lists all the repositories for a given Github username.

You can also check if a given account (with username and token) has starred the repositories and you can star/unstar them.

A personal access token with `public_repo` scope will be required for this and you can generate one by following [this Github link](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token)

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
